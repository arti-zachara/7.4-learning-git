                The world flashing past<br>
                So many of us moving so fast<br>
                I feel my heart slow<br>
                As we wonder I don't bow down<br>
                Nothing left undecided<br>
                Upon steel on steel<br>
                Through these cuts in the Earth<br>
                No question who was here first<br>
                Many dreams many lifetimes<br>
                Any of which could be me<br>
                Ecxept that I'm the one unable to move upon this machine<br>
                Upon this machine<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Pardon caravan emotion<br>
                Alone in crowds just like me<br>
                I fell between the moments<br>
                I fell between the endings<br>
                As rain runs around the windows<br>
                Nothing here is still<br>
                All the paths have collided<br>
                Through all these villages and hills<br>
                So many dreams so many lifetimes<br>
                Any of which could be me<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Ecxept that I'm the one unable to move upon this machine<br>
                Theres no one else, no one else, no one else, no one else.<br>
                Theres no...<br>
